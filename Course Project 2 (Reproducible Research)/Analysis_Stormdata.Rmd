# Overview

This R script analyzes weather event data to identify the top events with the greatest economic consequences and health impacts in the United States.

## Data

The analysis requires a dataset containing information on weather events, including variables such as event type (`EVTYPE`), property damage (`PROPDMG`), crop damage (`CROPDMG`), injuries (`INJURIES`), and fatalities (`FATALITIES`). The dataset should be in a CSV format and should include relevant columns for the analysis.

## Economic Consequences

The script aggregates property and crop damage data for each weather event type and identifies the top 10 events with the greatest economic consequences. It then creates a bar chart visualizing the cost of damage for each event type, highlighting both property and crop damage.
